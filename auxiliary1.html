            Doing things together.

    Having coffee or dinner together is a bit bulshit - you sure talk a lot, but eventually people know you (and you know people) for how you see yourself, and not for who you really are (same counts for them).

    Doing something together, especially if it is somewhat challenging - like building something, shows people how you react to setbacks, how you treat others when you are focused on your goal, what is the mode of your thinking process, how sensitive you are when things dont quite work, etc. Same counts for the people/person you are with. Cant imagine a better way to get to know someone if not seeing them (or showing yourself) in full action.

    p.s.: thats how in active workplace a lot of people fall in love with their “ugly” colleagues, whom they would otherwise never even invite for coffee.

    Good luck :-)
